<hr>

<p>Weather has a massive impact on human psychology. So much so that weather conditions even have the ability to cause mental health disorders like "Seasonal Affective Disorder." Tweets provide a rich resource for determining a population’s interests, opinions, and sentiment. Our group decided to integrate geo-tagged tweets and weather data in order to asses the large-scale impact on weather on the mood of Twitter users. </p>

<p>In our analysis, we also set out to see if we could observe differences in weather reaction between six cities with differing climates. Do jaded residents of rainy London or Seattle react differently to weather changes than those who live in sunny Los Angeles?   </p>

<a id="methodology" class="anchor" href="#methodology" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Methodology</h1>

<p>We began by collecting roughly 4.5 million geo-tagged Tweets from Boston, New York, Miami, Chicago, Seattle, Los Angeles, and London posted between November 21st to December 2nd 2014. Our Tweet scraper (built with <a href="http://www.tweepy.org">Tweepy</a>) was fed by Twitter’s free “<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview">Garden Hose</a>,” a live feed of roughly 10% of all Tweets. </p>

<p>We then utilized a Naive Bayes Classifier from <a href="http://textblob.readthedocs.org/en/dev/">TextBlob</a> (trained on a movie review corpus) to measure the sentiment of each tweet. </p>

<p>After scraping hourly temperature, humidity, and rainfall numeric readings as well as textual conditions tags from <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/">Weather Underground</a>, we merged our weather and twitter data. </p>

<a id="our-findings" class="anchor" href="#our-findings" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Our findings</h1>

<p>We found that there is no clear cut relationship between weather and Twitter sentiment in the cities we observed. The impact of different types of weather on Tweet sentiment appears to vary by city. </p>

<p>For example, C</p>

<p>Depending on how we classified rainy and , Twitter users from different cities appeared to  become more or less happy in either weather grouping. In general, Los Angeles, Seattle, and Chicago based users were more likely to show the relationship we expected; namely, more positive tweets during sunny weather versus rainy weather. New Yorkers are significantly less happy when it is raining heavily but appear to prefer cloudy days.</p>

<p>We did find several other interesting relationships in the data:
The majority of Tweets do not show high polarity as defined by our classifier. This problem will need to be solved by future researchers looking to investigate the relationship between Twitter Sentiment and weather data.
Of the cities we investigated, those with high precipitation had moderate temperatures and humidity (Boston and New York). The two driest cities had the highest temperatures (LA and Miami).
People seem to tweet the most late at night, with a noticeable spike around 10pm.
Sentiment follows very noticeable patterns depending on the time of day. Additionally, time seems to be a factor for temperature and humidity but not rainfall.
Americans seem to be happiest around 10 or 11 in the morning, and get progressively less happy throughout the day.
New York and L.A. produce more geo-tagged tweets than other cities.
Possibly the most interesting part of our project was the actual process itself. The fact that we were successfully able to automatically gather and analyze literally millions of Twitter statuses and merge them with automatically scraped weather data in order to create a useful data set that allows for analysis of weather and sentiment combined is really powerful. Techniques like those used in our project are opening up the possibilities for unprecedented frontiers in research that leverage the combined power of open data, profusion of internet connectivity, and accessible, yet powerful, programming languages like Python.</p>
