{"name":"Rainy Day Blues in 140 Characters","tagline":"CS109 Final Project by Andrew Campbell, Nathan Clement, and Ever Alvarado","body":"# How does weather impact the mood of Tweets?\r\n________________________\r\n\r\nWeather has a massive impact on human psychology. So much so that weather conditions even have the ability to cause mental health disorders like \"Seasonal Affective Disorder.\" Tweets provide a rich resource for determining a population’s interests, opinions, and emotions. Our group decided to integrate geo-tagged tweets and weather data in order to asses the large-scale impact of weather on the mood of Twitter users. \r\n\r\nIn our analysis, we also set out to see if we could observe differences in weather reaction between six cities with differing climates. Do jaded residents of rainy London or Seattle react differently to weather changes than those who live in sunny Los Angeles?   \r\n____\r\n\r\n# Methodology \r\n     \r\nWe began by collecting roughly 4.5 million geo-tagged Tweets from Boston, New York, Miami, Chicago, Seattle, Los Angeles, and London posted between November 21st to December 2nd 2014. Our Tweet scraper (built with [Tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org)) was fed by Twitter’s free “[Garden Hose](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview),” a live feed of roughly 10% of all Tweets. \r\n \r\nWe then utilized a Naive Bayes Classifier from [TextBlob](http://textblob.readthedocs.org/en/dev/) (trained on a movie review corpus) to measure the sentiment of each tweet. This algorithm labeled each tweet with a polarity value, -1 being the most negative, 1 the most positive. Tweets with a polarity of zero did not contain enough text to identify sentiment and we excluded them from our analysis. \r\n\r\nAfter scraping hourly temperature, humidity, and rainfall numeric readings as well as textual conditions tags from [Weather Underground](http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/), we merged our weather and twitter data. \r\n  \r\n_____\r\n\r\n# Our Findings\r\n\r\nWe found that there is no clear cut relationship between weather and Twitter sentiment in the cities we observed. The impact of different types of weather on Tweet sentiment appears to vary by city. The graphs below utilize scaled histograms of Tweet polarity to compare the impact of weather on happiness in finer detail.\r\n\r\n## Temperature\r\n\r\n### “Another Scorcher!\"\r\nWe found that when it is more than 8 degrees warmer than the normal temperature for that hour in a particular city, users from Los Angeles and Seattle become happier, while New Yorkers, Bostonians, and Miamians get a little grumpy.\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theandycamps/Twitter_Weather_Project/gh-pages/images/hotvsnothot.png)\r\n\r\n### “Brr... Its cold out here!”\r\n\r\nWhen it gets colder than 8 degrees below mean hourly temperature for a city, Londoners become unhappy while New Yorkers, Bostonians, and Chicagoans tend to share their smiles on the social web. \r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theandycamps/Twitter_Weather_Project/gh-pages/images/unusuallycold.png)\r\n\r\n## Rain or Shine \r\n### Binary Weather Grouping\r\nAfter grouping our 15 textual weather conditions tags (one of which is attached to every tweet) into two main categories, rainy and clear, we were able to observe some impact of broadly defined weather groups on Tweet polarity. Chicago, Los Angeles, and Seattle based users appear to prefer clear conditions while New Yorkers seem to enjoy a bit of rain! \r\n \r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theandycamps/Twitter_Weather_Project/gh-pages/images/rainyclearfix.png) \r\n\r\nIt is plausible that weather might only impact happiness during the day, when people are more likely to be outside. As such, we reran our analysis on the conditions tag groups using only tweets between 6:00 AM and 7:00 PM. During the day, it appears Los Angeles, London and Seattle users have the strongest preference for clear skies while New Yorkers still love their rain.\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theandycamps/Twitter_Weather_Project/gh-pages/images/dayimetitlefix.png)\r\n\r\n### “Its raining cats and dogs!\"\r\nHeavy rain (defined as rainfall greater than 0.02 inches per hour) appears to have a very substantial impact on sentiment in some cities. It seems that while New Yorkers may like a little rain, heavy rain really grinds their gears. Seattle, LA, Boston, and Chicago users also seem to have a distaste for downpour. (Note: London numerical precipitation data was corrupted and had to be excluded.)\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theandycamps/Twitter_Weather_Project/gh-pages/images/veryrainyfix.png)\r\n\r\n## Other Quirks\r\n\r\n### Seattle Light Drizzle\r\nIronically, Seattle Tweeters seemed to be bothered by a light drizzle! \r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theandycamps/Twitter_Weather_Project/gh-pages/images/Seattledrizzle2.png)\r\n\r\n### Boston Light Hail\r\nBostonians get *wicked ticked off* by hail.\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theandycamps/Twitter_Weather_Project/gh-pages/images/Bostonsmallhail.png)\r\n\r\n### New York Light Snow\r\nThe Big Apple loves a little snow.   \r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theandycamps/Twitter_Weather_Project/gh-pages/images/nylightsnow.png)\r\n\r\n_____\r\n# Time Trends\r\nWe found that our Tweet volume, polarity and weather data all seemed to follow daily trends. The previous analysis was careful to control for time, as it constitutes a substantial potential bias. Some of the trends are quite interesting! \r\n\r\n## Tweet Volume\r\n\r\nOur cities follow slightly different patterns in the volume of tweets they produce each hour, but in general very few people tweet early in the morning and activity peaks around 10:00 PM. New York and L.A. produce more tweets than the other cities.\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theandycamps/Twitter_Weather_Project/gh-pages/images/proportionoftweetsbyhr.png)\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theandycamps/Twitter_Weather_Project/gh-pages/images/stackedhistofixed.png)\r\n\r\n## Polarity Time Trend\r\n\r\nTweet polarity also follow a time trend throughout the day. This trend is similar for American cities, with happiness peaking around 10:00 AM. Interestingly, Londoners follows a distinctly different pattern, getting happiest around 3:00 PM. (Note: All data is corrected for time zone)\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theandycamps/Twitter_Weather_Project/gh-pages/images/polarity%20by%20hour.png)\r\n\r\n## Weather Time Trends\r\nWe observed that each city follows its own distinct weather pattern. Temperature and humidity follow trends while precipitation appears more random. \r\n### Temperature\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theandycamps/Twitter_Weather_Project/gh-pages/images/tempbyhour.png) \r\n### Humidity\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theandycamps/Twitter_Weather_Project/gh-pages/images/humidity%20by%20hour.png)\r\n### Rainfall\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theandycamps/Twitter_Weather_Project/gh-pages/images/rainfallhourlytogether.png)\r\n\r\n# Thanks for reading! \r\nWe would be happy to share our dataset.
