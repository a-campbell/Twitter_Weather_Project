{"name":"Rainy Day Blues in 140 Characters","tagline":"CS109 Final Project by Andrew Campbell, Nathan Clement, and Ever Alvarado","body":"# How does the weather impact the mood of Tweets?\r\n________________________\r\n\r\nWeather has a massive impact on human psychology. So much so that weather conditions even have the ability to cause mental health disorders like \"Seasonal Affective Disorder.\" Tweets provide a rich resource for determining a population’s interests, opinions, and sentiment. Our group decided to integrate geo-tagged tweets and weather data in order to asses the large-scale impact on weather on the mood of Twitter users. \r\n\r\nIn our analysis, we also set out to see if we could observe differences in weather reaction between six cities with differing climates. Do jaded residents of rainy London or Seattle react differently to weather changes than those who live in sunny Los Angeles?   \r\n____\r\n\r\n# Methodology \r\n     \r\nWe began by collecting roughly 4.5 million geo-tagged Tweets from Boston, New York, Miami, Chicago, Seattle, Los Angeles, and London posted between November 21st to December 2nd 2014. Our Tweet scraper (built with [Tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org)) was fed by Twitter’s free “[Garden Hose](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview),” a live feed of roughly 10% of all Tweets. \r\n \r\nWe then utilized a Naive Bayes Classifier from [TextBlob](http://textblob.readthedocs.org/en/dev/) (trained on a movie review corpus) to measure the sentiment of each tweet. This algorithm labeled each tweet with a polarity value, -1 being the most negative, 1 the most positive. Tweets with a polarity of zero did not contain enough text to identify sentiment and we excluded them from our analysis. \r\n\r\nAfter scraping hourly temperature, humidity, and rainfall numeric readings as well as textual conditions tags from [Weather Underground](http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/), we merged our weather and twitter data. \r\n  \r\n_____\r\n\r\n# Our Findings\r\n\r\nWe found that there is no clear cut relationship between weather and Twitter sentiment in the cities we observed. The impact of different types of weather on Tweet sentiment appears to vary by city. \r\n\r\n### Rain \r\n\r\nAfter grouping our 15 textual weather conditions tags (one of which is attached to every tweet) into two main categories, rainy and clear, we were able to observe some impact of weather on the distributions of Tweet polarity. Chicago, Los Angeles, and Seattle based users appear to prefer clear conditions while New Yorkers seem to enjoy a bit of rain! \r\n \r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theandycamps/Twitter_Weather_Project/gh-pages/images/Rainy%20vs.%20Clear.png) \r\n\r\nIt is plausible that weather might only impact happiness during the day, when people are more likely to be outside. As such, we reran our analysis on the conditions tag groups using only tweets between 6:00 AM and 7:00 PM. During the day, it appears Los Angeles, London and Seattle users have the strongest preference for clear skies while New Yorkers still love their rain.\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theandycamps/Twitter_Weather_Project/gh-pages/images/Daytime.png)\r\n\r\nHeavy rain (defined as rainfall greater than 0.02 In per hour) appears to have a very substantial impact on sentiment in some cities. It seems that while New Yorkers may like a little rain, heavy rain really grinds their gears. Seattle, LA, Boston, and Chicago users also seem to have a distaste for downpour. (Note: London numerical precipitation data was corrupted and had to be excluded)\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theandycamps/Twitter_Weather_Project/gh-pages/images/heavy%20rain.png)\r\n\r\nInterestingly enough, Seattle Tweeters seemed to be bothered by light rain! \r\n\r\n### Seattle Light Rain\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theandycamps/Twitter_Weather_Project/gh-pages/images/seattle%20light%20drizzle.png)\r\n\r\n_____\r\n# Other Interesting Findings\r\n\r\n### Tweet Volume\r\n\r\nWe stumbled upon some other interesting trends in our data on our inquiry. Our cities follow slightly different patterns in the volume of tweets they produce each hour, but in general very few people tweet early in the morning and activity peaks around 10:00 PM. New York and L.A. produce more tweets than the other cities.\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theandycamps/Twitter_Weather_Project/gh-pages/images/total_tweet_stacked_hist.png)\r\n\r\n### Polarity Time Trend\r\n\r\nTweet polarity also follow a time trend throughout the day. This trend is similar for American cities, with happiness peaking around 10:00 AM. Interestingly, Londoners follows a distinctly different pattern, getting happiest around 3:00 PM. (Note: All data is corrected for time zone)\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theandycamps/Twitter_Weather_Project/gh-pages/images/polarity%20by%20hour.png)\r\n\r\n### Weather Time Trends\r\nIn comparing polarity and weather, we must be careful to account for time trends. We observed that each city follows distinct weather patterns.\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theandycamps/Twitter_Weather_Project/gh-pages/images/tempbyhour.png) \r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theandycamps/Twitter_Weather_Project/gh-pages/images/humidity%20by%20hour.png)\r\n\r\nHowever, rainfall does not appear to follow a daily time trend. \r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theandycamps/Twitter_Weather_Project/gh-pages/images/rain%20by%20hour.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
